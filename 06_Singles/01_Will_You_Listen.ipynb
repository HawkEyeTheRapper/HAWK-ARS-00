    "Will you listen? I hope you listen
Will you listen? I hope you listen

Yo, I step up on the stage and let these beats play
With this microphone I came
To change the game, if that's okay
Look, no one asked me but I'll tell you anyway
I think that everyone who's rapping nowadays is kind of lame
I make this music to influence and inspire
But this culture's full of Vultures
So I hope that you are tired
Of mindless shit, cause my descriptive lyrics hit
On certain issues that I wish you'd take seriously kids
Not trying to hurt you
But I worked too hard to sort
Through all this fucking propaganda
To not stand here and alert you
Our planet's damaged, so here we go again
Let's see if Hawk can truly manage
To rework these words for them

Um... You fucking puppets just don't trust it
I'm disgusted by reluctant motherfuckers
Who've adjusted to the corruption
It's not a game
If we don't change the way we think
Then we will never rearrange a damn thing
We're on the brink
A whole world full of people too deceitful
To be peaceful - all this evil
Indiscreetly keeps us weakened
You hear me speaking
But this teaching seems too preachy
Who's to reach you if these words
Do not delete these cheapened reasons
To keep sleeping, I am seeking in this verse
For a way to truly sneak in and reverse this curse
So as you listen, my intention gets worse
Not here to entertain you
Should I have mentioned this first? I'm on a mission
This prescription I've rehearsed
Is meant for interventions in your systems
I am just the nurse
But this witch doctor has been authorized to operate
If you do not comply, then I will have to start to propagate

My music penetrates
So fluidly that I'm afraid
You'll have to hear it anyways
This Druid speech is not afraid
To take over airwaves
I go there and I'll stay
Just like a terrorist, this therapist's nefarious schemes
Leaves you defenseless - So bear witness
All your interests are relentlessly designed
To keep you blind, but when you hear this
You admit that senseless shit was entertaining
But you let Hawkeye explain it
And now your brain has been retrained

See - It's legitimate
This lyricist you're hearing is sick
And fucking tired of pretending
Like his fire's not lit
So inspired, I go higher
My desire
is to write these lucid statements
That I'm making and replace
The men who try
To use their baseless information
Just for payment - Change the station
All debates will be erased

Hear what I'm saying
I am clearly keeping you entranced
That's cause I got shit to say and I do not dance
My music knew it couldn't be watered down
So I just use it to keep fluently repeating myself
This world is fucked, we best wake up, oh well
No one can hear me, but I'm seriously seeking to help

So will you listen? I hope you listen
Will you listen? I hope you listen
Will you listen? I hope you listen\n",
