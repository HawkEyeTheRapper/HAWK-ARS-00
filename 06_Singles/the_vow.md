Write your, write your name down, bitch
I'll write your, write your name down
Write your, write your name down
Your name down, your name down

Yo, don't make me go and write your fuckin' name down, bitch
Cause once you're on it, there's only one way off of this list
And I hope you know it's always personal
These words that I spit, they're controversial

On purpose, ho, and no, I won't quit
I'll write your fuckin' name down
I'll write your fuckin' name down, bitch
I'll write your fuckin' name down

Your name down, your name down
What I really mean to say, express, convey, and make clear
Is that my shirt says, shoot your local pedophile, for real
Did I stutter? Can't you deaf bitches hear

Hawkeyes, that guy who came to make sure you all disappear
So fuck your rappin' highly weird
Celebrity acting my career
Is putting fear back into God, it's so traumatic

So when I cause you to feel like you're the only one this happened to
Just know I had to do something about the fact that this planet
Is full of fuckin' foolish adults so cartoonish
That I'm not sure any child can mature if exposed to it

But you fucks keep pushing your luck with me
I'm not gonna budge, either stand the fuck down or suck on these nuts
Yo, don't make me go and write your fuckin' name down, bitch
Cause once you're on it, there's only one way off of this list

And I hope you know it's always personal
These words that I spit, they're controversial on purpose
So I know I won't quit
I'll write your fuckin' name down

I'll write your fuckin' name down, bitch
I'll write your fuckin' name down
Your name down, your name down
What you thought this was?
That badge don't make you Superman

Clark Kent, I'll put a dent in your shield just cause I can
You little bitch, I know it pisses you off when I show you
That I won't submit, these other people might bow down
But just know I won't quit

Unload the flow, kill those exposed, expose them hoes and then reload
Unleash the beast, complete defeat, cannot compete at all
Capisce, I won't relent, so don't forget
Reincarnated to resist, means you're retarded

If you ever try to come and start some shit
I'll write your name upon a page and make you famous, bitch
Do not engage, just walk away before I strangle you with
This tangled language its so dangerous

This game you insist on playing with me
Couldn't get me even if the whole (state) gang assists
Don't make me go and write your fuckin' name down, bitch
Cause once you're on it, there's only one way off of this list

And I hope you know it's always personal
These words that I spit, they're controversial
On purpose, ho, and no, I won't quit
I'll write your fuckin' name down

I'll write your fuckin' name down, bitch
I'll write your fuckin' name down
Your name down
Your name down
