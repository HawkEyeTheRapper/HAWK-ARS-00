    "7 - The Devil's In The Details

Sunday, June 30, 2024

The Devil's in the details

The Devil's in the details

The Devil's in the details

Here, let me sever the connection altogether

Because the Devil is in the details

I never let this shit get to me - So fuck the Propaganda

I don't give a damn about your plan - I can handle

Your cleverly twisted schemes - Understand just who I am

Before you bitches get restricted - See

I came to wake my Legion - If you need another reason

Hunting Demons is my Passion - I ain't asking

I'm deleting every last one I see

So do you really wanna keep fucking around

Cause you are bound to be

Another motherfucker who's found six feet deep

Underground - I won't allow Bullshit to Speak

Very Loud for too long - So sit down - I'm appalled

And I am called to humble Proud motherfuckers - Get the Saw

Cut the shit - I'm too belligerent to ever let you Bitches get

Confused, here's the rules - I ain't letting you win shit

Because the Devil is in the Details

So take your best shot - Oh I forgot to mention

I'm in position now bitch and my Trigger Finger's itching

So call the Mortician and the Cops

Because my murderous intervention can't be stopped

I'm here to make sure you listen - Observe - Pay attention

The discerner of wisdom always drops

Jewels for you Fools - Shit hidden from your view

Right there in front of you - Point Blank - You never knew

These cryptic hieroglyphic archetypal inscriptions

Were symbolic universal languages written

Specifically to trick your mind - Subconscious hypnotism

Sigils Witches use to get you to forget your intuition

The Devil's in the details

Here, let me sever the connection altogether - It's my pleasure

I am what you bitches fear

Divine Intervention when my Rhymes hit your ear

The Devil's in the details

Here, let me sever the connection altogether - It's my pleasure

To interfere

Listen here

To interfere

Listen here

I am what you bitches fear

Divine Intervention when my Rhymes hit your ear

I'm a Lethal weapon stepping down from heaven

7 Spiritual Officials left the Throne they were protecting

Just to hear my Lyrical insurrection

Second guess it all you want - Just know my Rhymes still threaten

Every section of hell, and yeah I'm wishing 'em well

But when I get to spitting fire all you Liars will melt

I'm required to entirely obliterate fools

Who conspire to defy my Dictates and you

Motherfuckers might of thought this wasn't serious but

Guess what - I'll twist these words till you're delirious from

Tryna wrap your mind around the shit I'm pounding in your head

Till you give up and finally fucking hear what I said

With just words I'll conjure up the perfect storm for you

Subtle changes rearranging every angle to

Mention that my Magick ripped the fabric back then

In 2019

Epstein Voodoo

You're too late to stop me 2020 came and I dropped Full Disclosure right before Covid Craziness locked Down the whole fucking planet, god damn it - Why not Distract us with more scare tactics - but Ghislaine got popped Now I know you bitches hear me - Loud and Clear My guerrillas in the trenches have surrounded you queers No quarter - My orders say Exterminate So I hate to inform you but there is no more debate You can see the net closing in tightly but when I spring this fucking trap that you're already in Then you'll really get the picture of my problematic scripture I am here with the elixir - drink it up, this shit'll fix ya All warfare's deception so I had to be An infection you neglected till you had to see The results of my inception I am second to none You never had enough weapons - I already won
